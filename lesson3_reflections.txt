When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would like to have a remote repository when more than one person
works on a project. So we will have a common place where we can push and pull
our changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is better we pull the master and do the changes locally.
Meanwhile our team mates can change the master. So we keep ours in
a seperate branch and pull the new up to date master.
THen we can merge it with our branch and changes will be reflected. 
But there can be merge conflict which we need to fix and commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - Forks are the clone that we do on a git hub level. Because many ppl
share their code but they allow others to change their code base. So we can fork
it a maintain with our fithub account.
Clones - Clones are basiclally like downloading from github into 
our local repository. Here we will be also be connected to remote
repo from which we cloned in the first place. Here we can collaborate and push and pull
changes to.
Branch - We  can create a branch and work on it so master remain untouched. May be after a month
we refresh master using git pull and then we can merge with our change into master and
push it back to github.
