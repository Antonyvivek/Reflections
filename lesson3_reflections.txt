When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would like to have a remote repository when more than one person
works on a project. So we will have a common place where we can push and pull
our changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is better we pull the master and do the changes locally.
Meanwhile our team mates can change the master. So we keep ours in
a seperate branch and pull the new up to date master.
THen we can merge it with our branch and changes will be reflected. 
But there can be merge conflict which we need to fix and commit.
